# University-Data-Model-Schema
This is the initial creation of a data model I created for University data I got from Kagle.
 Most of the information was lost when I built a new computer and attempted a transfer from my old hardrive.
 The model was loaded into a local MySQL system on the old HDD.
 I was told to post and update the process anyway.
 All csv files used are present except the course_offerings.csv which was lost and I need to reaquire.
